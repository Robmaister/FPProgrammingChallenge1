This project is my attempt to complete a 5-day challenge to get 3D balls to
roll around on a plane and be able to bounce off each other. I never got the
original challenge completed due to time restraints and lack of knowledge in
physics. Now I have the knowledge in physics but still lack the amount of time
necessary to get anything done on this project. I'd still love to use F# for
some math instead of just setting up OpenGL via OpenTK. Here is a link to the
thread on Facepunch for reference: http://www.facepunch.com/threads/1106393
